Task         : Goertzel filter implementation 

This repo homes details, files for the homework task in Microelectronics & HW/SW Co-Design. 

The task specification content is below:

●	Number of samples - 135
●	Input data - 12 bit
●	Internal data - 20 bit
●	Sample frequency - 4MHz
●	Signal frequency to detect - 150 KHz

The code files have been written in VHDL & Matlab. Firstly, the goertzel filter is implemented in Matlab and then in VHDL along with testbench. The stimuli data and expected results have been generated in Matlab for the testbench process. 

In order to run the VHDL files executer.sh has been made which can be found in the repo. Commands in executer.sh are run with --std=08 option(flag).

Repo content:
1) Matlab files
2) VHDL files
3) Presentation
4) Report
